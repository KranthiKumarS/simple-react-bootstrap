Dirt simple React bindings for a Bootstrap Modal

# Installing

If you're using a tool to manage your npm installs, like WebPack or jspm, then just import it with 

`import Modal from 'simple-react-bootstrap-modal'`

If you're just using a script loader, like SystemJS, you'll first need to configure the path to `dist/Modal.js`, as in 

`"simple-react-bootstrap-modal": "node_modules/simple-react-bootstrap-modal/dist/Modal.js",`

There's also a minified version, if you don't already have some sort of bundling and minifying process. 

Static build file that can be loaded with a `script` tag, with a `Modal` global variable added, can be found at `node_modules/simple-react-bootstrap-Modal/dist/ModalStaticBuild.min.js`
