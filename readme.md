# Installing

If you're using a tool to manage your npm installs, like WebPack or jspm, then just import it with 

`import NavBar from 'simple-react-bootstrap-navbar'`

If you're just using a script loader, like SystemJS, configure the path to `dist/NavBar.js`, as in 

`"simple-react-bootstrap-navbar": "node_modules/simple-react-bootstrap-navbar/dist/NavBar.js",`

Static build file that can be loaded with a `script` tag isn't yet supported.
